            <h4 class="text-center text-light"><P>Here at the Better-Book-barter, we aim to expand book circulation through a not-for-profit bartering business model. The end goal being a means for which users can share books they have loved and maybe discover new favorites!</P>
          
            <p><strong>So, how does it work?</strong></p>
            
           <p><strong>1.</strong> Donate a book to our library and earn a credit. One book donated equals one credit.</p> 
            <p><strong>2.</strong> Search our library of books available</p> 
            <p><strong>3.</strong> Select a book you would like to read</p>
            <p><strong>4.</strong> Checkout</p>
           
            <p>Itâ€™s a simple as that. For every book you donate, you receive a credit that can be used to order a new book! Once you have finished this book, return it and receive another credit that can be used for another book.</p>
